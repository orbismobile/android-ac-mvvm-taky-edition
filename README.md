## Summary

This Android Sample Project uses MVVM architectural pattern helped by three powerful technologies
which are Kotlin, Dagger 2 and Architecture Components.

Additionally this project uses the Repository Pattern.


## How Does it work?

At first, searches a user from local DB and shows on the screen but If if we don't have any user then
we'll fetch data from Remote(our Web Service).

## How to add new package like test_common inside src folder?
1. Change to Project View Type.
2. Right click on src folder.
3. Go to New > Directory > test_common.
4. Right click on test_common folder > New > Folder > Java Folder > change folder destination > **src/test_common/java**
